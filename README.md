```

git clone 

```

- You need to install composer and npm before running other Laravel scripts.

```

composer install
npm install

```

- After installing composer and npm, copy the .env.example file to .env and configure your database and other settings:

```

cp .env.example .env

```

- After copying .env.example to .env, Open the .env file and update the following lines:

```

DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
